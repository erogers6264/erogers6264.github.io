title: Settling in
---

Hi. The dust is starting to settle around here and I am feeling more at home. I
needed a place to write about my programming journey. I have been creating it from
scratch but by doing that I haven't had a home to write about that process, which
is why I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Its blog-awareness is making it
very easy to get started.

#### New around here
I have never been a professional web developer. I have been a professional
German teacher. All of my studies focused on subjects like linguistics, German
literature, film and history, critical theory, philosophy, second-language
acquisition, and a lot more.

In my free time, I constructed my own computers from cheap parts, fiddled around in
[LucidLynx](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx), and played with Python. I designed
a template for our new fraternity website. I published blog posts for a student
government organization. Javascript was easy to fool around in. One of my favorite
things to do is read documentation. I am attracted to software that has a good
sense of humor. It makes programming that more enjoyable.

#### Becoming a web pro
I left my career as a German teacher because of the impossibility of some of the
barriers I faced.

``` python
>>> def newFunction(argument):
	    look = "what I can do."
	    print argument + " " + look
>>> newFunction("Smell")
"Smell what I can do."
```

In software, it seems like the barriers are more within than without. Perhaps
I am wrong, but I have had to tell myself that I am a web developer consistently
for quite a while before I finally believed it.
