title: Descending Up
---

It was a week today that I started going to a gym again. I used to start the
week with leg day to get it over with... It can get pretty intense. I am keeping
up with that idea but I have the sense that I look forward to it more.

When I decided to change my career a year ago this month, I new that I would be
undertaking an intense shift in my ideas about work would be like. I had to get
used to sitting with a computer all the time. I had to recognize when a break,
like a walk outside or a glass of wine, would be more productive than continuing
to code. Even if I'm not physically 'coding', I am still trying to think about
things from a programming perspective.

This gets difficult when you encounter all the fallacy and unreasonableness in
the world, but then again I remind myself that computers and computer languages
were made by people.
